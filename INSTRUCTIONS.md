# Linay Comics

## Purpose

A website to host the comics, each comic could be 4-6 pages, we need to make it like a gallery, and have a way for user to move from page 1 to 2, and so on.

comics are stored in their own folders, and pages are numbered (eg. comic1-dynamic-dude-and-ideas/strip1.jpg, .../strip2.jpg)


## Details

I want to host this website as git hub pages. 
I want to use jekyll theme, so we probably should generate MD files for the comics
